<h1>Goku's Journey</h1>
<h1>Super Saiyan Goku</h1>
<p>For 1,000 years the myth of The Legendary Super Saiyan stayed just that, a myth. Until Goku achieved the form after witnessing the death of Krillin at the hands of Frieza.</p>
<p>In this form, his power skyrockets being able to square up against a fully powered Frieza (and mop him). He even gave Android 19 a run for his money before the heart disease kicked it. </p>
<p>This effectively made it his base form and allowed him to overcome even greater feats through it. Goku became stronger than both grades simply by mastering it, receiving all the boosts without any of the consequences. </p>
<h2>Super Saiyan 2</h2>
<P>Goku spent 7 years in Other World after his death during the Cell Games. It is only natural that Goku spent his time training, and for the 25th Budokai, no less.</P>
<P>Super Saiyan 2 is a large boost in power from Mastered Super Saiyan.It is enough for Goku to be an even match with Majin Vegeta, but nowhere near strong enough to beat Majin Buu. Impressive to say the least. </P>
<p>Unveiled during the Majin Buu Saga, Goku kept this form hidden from Majin Vegeta during their fight. Realizing that Majin Buu was too dangerous to keep roaming around, he had to stall him before he could teach Goten and Trunks the Fusion Dance. </p>
<h3>Super Saiyan 3</h3>
<P>This form has more of a visual difference than the previous form of Super Saiyan, with long glowing spikey golden hair extended all the way down to Goku’s legs. </P>
<p>This form was strong enough to take on Majin Buu, but the drawbacks are too great as it is incredibly unstable. Drawing too much stamina and Ki from Goku, he was only able to use it at the time because he was dead, even then it was giving him trouble.</p>
<p>This is because the more he used it the shorter it would make his time on earth. As strong as this form might be, the drawbacks are crazy.  </p>
<h4>Super Saiyan God</h4>
<p>In this form, Goku was able to go toe-to-toe with Beerus using 70% of his power (in the movie). He was also able to hold his own against Broly for a bit before Broly adapted and overpowered him.</p>
<p>There is a catch, however, to receive this form the user must either perform a ritual with 5 other good-hearted Saiyans or go through divine training to achieve God Ki.</p>
<p>Surrounded by a fiery red aura, the skin turns a pinkish color, and hair maintains its normal style while becoming more refined and turning a magenta kind of red, Super Saiyan God is one of the most visually appealing forms Goku has had to date. </p>
<h5>Super Saiyan Blue</h5>
<p>Introduced in Resurrection F, next up we have Super Saiyan Blue (Super Saiyan God Super Saiyan). Mixing Super Saiyan Ki and God Ki perfectly achieves this form.</p>
<p>There isn’t much else to say about this form as it’s just Super Saiyan on literal God Mode. It can go blow-for-blow with most of Dragon Ball Super’s baddies and get the job done. </p>
<p>Super Saiyan Blue boasts a vibrant, fiery, electric blue aura, as opposed to the blazing orange aura of Super Saiyan God. The aura surrounding the Super Saiyan Blue form also appears to be glittering somewhat, with small sparkling particles of energy traveling upwards within the flames, with occasional surges of electricity.</p>
<h6> Ultra Instinct</h6>
<p>This is easily Goku’s strongest form in the entire franchise so far. His power puts him in the same category as Whis and Beerus. He mops the floor with Jirn in this form completely turning the tides of the battle.</p>
<p>Much like when Goku masters any of his forms, Mastered Ultra Instinct has all the insane power of -Sign- but with practically no drawbacks. The only one is that it eats away at his body after extended use.</p>
<p>Even with that slight drawback, the form is so strong Goku nearly achieved victory against Jiren with great ease if not for the time limit. That concludes all of Goku’s canon forms, from weakest to strongest.</p>
